GopherSource is an initiative to strengthen and diversify the Go ecosystem through
building up more contributors to upstream Go and key Go projects from the within the community.
These are a few of the things that I'll be working on going forward, and I want
you to [join me](/start):

<center>
💪 Become upstream Go contributors!<br/>
🙌 Give feedback on Go as reviewers!<br/>
💥 Make official Go proposals, and implement them!<br/>
😇 Annoy Google with 💖 ALL 🦄 THE 🌈 EMOJI 😎!
</center>

I can't do this alone; I'm gonna need all y'alls help. This my "bat signal"
to the gopher community: beginner gophers
and grizzled gophers alike. If you are interested in learning Go, are looking to
contribute to open-source but aren't sure where to start, have feels about fostering
a better Go community, want to learn the ropes for making changes to Go, or just
don't know what to do with your Saturday nights, [join me](/start).

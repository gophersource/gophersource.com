Athens is a project that builds on top of Go Modules (in go1.11+) to bring
dependencies closer to you so you can count on repeatable builds even at a time
when the source server is down.

The big goal of Athens is to provide a new place where dependencies — not code — live.
Dependencies are immutable blobs of code and associated metadata that come from
Github. They live in storage that Athens controls.
